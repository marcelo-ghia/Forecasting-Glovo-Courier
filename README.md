# Forecasting-Glovo-Courier

Imagine you just joined Glovo. Glovo follows a slot-based system for the couriers to fullfil the orders that come in. For simplification, you can imagine those slots are non-overlapping hours, so that every every city has 24 slots every day, one for each hour. Glovo needs to know the optimal number of couriers that are needed on every hour slot of every city. Too many couriers, and there will be many idle couriers not earning money. Too few couriers, and orders will have to wait to be processed, leading to higher delivery times.

At the moment, Operations decides manually how many couriers are needed, based on past demand. As the number of cities grows, this becomes unsustainable. They want to automate the process by which they decide how many courier-slots should be opened every hour. For simplification, we can assume that every Sunday at midnight, we need to know how many couriers we need for every hour of the week that is starting. That means that if today is Sunday, May 8th 23:59, they want us to know how many orders will be placed every hour of the week that goes from May 9th 00:00 to May 15th 23:00, both included. Every Sunday, you can use all data from that week to forecast the next one.

This problem has many steps, but we will keep this project to the order forecast for one city: we want to know, for one city and every Sunday, how many orders we're going to receive on every hour of the upcoming week.
